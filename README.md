This personal project is for me to analyze Canadian stocks using the Yahoo Finance API to make a list of potential stocks to buy.
I have used a combination of technical indicators, statistical analysis, and personal constraints to make a comprehensive list of stocks I can look at with respect to their momentum.
I also have deployed the code on AWS so that I can automate it and work on the cloud.
